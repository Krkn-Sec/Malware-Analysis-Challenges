# Malware-Analysis-Challenges
A collection of binaries created by me to simulate common malware techniques. The binaries aren't truly malicious. Any shellcode or payloads they execute either spawn a message box or pops calc. I'm not here to spread malware, only analysis techniques.

---

Some of the binaries will hold flags in the form of "flag{flag_goes_here}" while others will just pop a calc/messagebox. The ones where there's a flag will be showing off a particular malware technique whereas the ones without flags will need to be completely analyzed. I did this for two reasons.

1.) I'm not a programmer
2.) I think it's important to have the one-off techniques for learning purposes and bigger/more complicated binaries for applying what you learned.

I will try to use multiple languages as well to maximize the learning. Besides the regular C/C++ I also will use Go, Nim, .NET, and Python to create executables. This way you'll have exposure to more languages that are growing in usage in the world of malware.
