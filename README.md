# Malware-Analysis-Challenges
A collection of binaries created by me to simulate common malware techniques. The binaries aren't truly malicious. Any shellcode or payloads they execute either spawn a message box or pops calc. I'm not here to spread malware, only analysis techniques.

---

Some of the binaries will hold flags in the form of "flag{flag_goes_here}" while others will just pop a calc/messagebox. The ones where there's a flag will be showing off a particular malware technique whereas the ones without flags will need to be completely analyzed. I did this for two reasons.

1.) I'm not a programmer
2.) I think it's important to have the one-off techniques for learning purposes and bigger/more complicated binaries for applying what you learned.

I will try to use multiple languages as well to maximize the learning. Besides the regular C/C++ I also will use Go, Nim, .NET, and Python to create executables. This way you'll have exposure to more languages that are growing in usage in the world of malware.

## Real Malware Sample Challenges
Here are a list of malware samples that I think are great to use for training in various techniques. **Remember that these are REAL samples! Please only download these in a protected malware analysis lab! I am not responsible if you download and run these on your home PC!**
- [Neshta](https://samples.vx-underground.org/samples/Families/Neshta/): Neshta is a file infector. It infects all EXEs on the victim machine to include the malicious Neshta code. This is very good practice for learning how to follow memory buffers and file manipulation techniques as it will also replace the first few instructions of the EXE to run the Neshta code and then go back to running the legitimate executable.
- [Cobalt Strike](https://samples.vx-underground.org/samples/Families/CobaltStrike/): Cobalt Strike is a red teamer tool that is used by both legitimate penetration testers as well as cyber criminals. Cobalt strike beacons are used in loads of criminal infections so I include this for practice on extraction the beacon configurations to find the C2s.
- [Hawkeye Keylogger](https://samples.vx-underground.org/samples/Families/HawkEyeKeylogger/): Hawkeye Keylogger is a keylogger written in C#. Once unpacked and deobfuscated, the reversing is actually very straight forward. I include this as practice for .NET binaries.
- [IcedID](https://samples.vx-underground.org/samples/Families/IcedId/): IcedID is a loader that's pretty prominent in the malware space. This was one of the malware families where I learned how to find and decrypt malware configs and write an automated config extractor. If it worked for me then I hope it'll work for someone else.
- [QuasarRAT](https://samples.vx-underground.org/samples/Families/QuasarRAT/): This is an open-source RAT written in C# that you can find on Github. I wanted to include this to provide an easier sample to analyze RAT TTPs.
